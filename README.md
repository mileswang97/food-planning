# food-planning
 plan comprehensive weekly or bi-weekly diets, with recipes

# ROADMAP

### Data collection

1. Gather and validate database of daily nutritional requirements for both genders of different age groups
2. Gather and validate database of nutritional facts for fresh produce, common brand names, and several popular restaurant dishes
3. Gather highly-rated fresh recipes from online sources and break down their ingredients list into the dishes' nutritional components
4. Figure out how to gather data on gut bacteria, their importance and how to cultivate them. Not sure if this is viable.

### Dietary insight

5. Create an excel form for approximating current diet -> highlight improvements for nutritional quotas that aren't met
6. Create an excel form for creating the ideal diet given one's preferences (manual creation)

### Website / UI

7. Host this on github website domain in a user-friendly and more visually appealing way
8. Add ways to create and save profiles with preferences

### Automation

9. Write a script that randomizes foods in such a way that dietary quotas are met
10. Modify such a script to take into account preferences, allergies, and otherwise "no-go" foods (maybe they're unavailable locally)
11. Find a way to balance such priorities in step 10 with some exploration
12. Suggest recipes using foods in one's diet plan that covers their groceries from the recipe database
